This is a reservation system for parking garages. Users can search for their reservations by phone number and cancel them if they are at least three days in advance. The system retrieves reservation details from a MySQL database, and updates the status of canceled reservations. Administrator can query the available spots and revenue from a garage on given date. The system uses PHP for the server-side scripting and HTML/CSS for the user interface.
